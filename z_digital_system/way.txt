write a traffic light code . that we have 2 diferent traffic light as light1 and light2 ,
 any light has 3 colors yellow, green, red . with 6 port as 0 and 1 we want to control 2 traffic light .
  port G1 for green light of light1 , G2 for green light of light2 , port R1 for red light of light1 ,
   port R2 for red light of light2 , prot Y1 for yellow light of light 1 , port Y2 for yellow light of light2 ,
    from sec=0 to sec=2 do(Y1=1 , Y2=1 ,G1=1 ,G2=0 ,R1=0 ,R2=1 ) , then from sec=2 to sec=30 do(Y1=0 , Y2=0 ,G1=0 ,G2=1 ,R1=1 ,R2=0 ) ,
     then from sec=30 to sec=32 do(Y1=1 , Y2=1 ,G1=0 ,G2=1 ,R1=1 ,R2=0 ) , then from sec=32 to sec=60 do(Y1=0 , Y2=0 ,G1=1 ,G2=0 ,R1=0 ,R2=1 ) ,
      and every 60 seconds repeat this code .
