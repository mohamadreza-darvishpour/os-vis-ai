   ****   active hdl   **** 



write a code for fpga , vhdl . 
simulating and show the wave of
 ports by activehdl program. the code
  for 2 port as A , B and every one 
  second change a to 1 and b to 0 and reverse.
   write any thing need  to run or simulating and 
   showing the wave in active hdl. describe code 
   completely. write any different code needed like 
   test code , wave code , main code . 
then describe completely from making new workspace and 
even clicks on program . 

______________________________________



workspace : manage several projects symultaniously. 

design : in active hdl means collection of source files . 





_______________________*********************
start 

--make new workspace : 
file > new > workspace 

--then in new pop up page 
--need work space name 
-- put tick on new design buttom to add new design . 

--then in new dessign wizard page 
--click on first : add empty design 

--then 
--in property page : 
-- better to leave it as it is . but : 
block diagram config : default hdl language 
default hdl langu : vhdl 
--target technology >>>   as in videos to learning 
vendor : intel 
technology : cyblonelvgx 
and next . 
--then 
-- in new design wizard add name  and next 
--then  check the specification and next . 
--finish making new workspace . :

***   making new vhdl file to write program . 
in design part > add new file 
--then in pop up page we have 2 tab ( empty file , wizard) 
--better to use 'wizard' because autoam... make the first source file. 
--go to 'wizard' 
--click on make vhdl source file . 
--then in new source file wizard : put tick on new pop up page : 
--that pop up page put tick on ' add the generated file to the design
next. 
--then 
--add just name to the new pop up page and 
next 

--then 
--in ports pop up page 
add the input,output,... and all different ports. 
--then 
finish
