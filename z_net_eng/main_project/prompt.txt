i need java file  net_server.java that do these works: 
it shold handle request with sufficient header like http and https , 
and we have a folder named "files_to_answer" 
then when we get a request from a session or any ip we should send the file requested from client. 
it is look like the nginx . 
for example if header is good and request say that need 'index_page.html' file it should send that html file . 

in other hand the config must have some options that given from a 'server_config.txt' file 
the file 'server_config.txt' contains text that : 
syn_request_limit=3 ;    // it says that just make 3 thread for request means just 3 request synchronizely answered not more . 
blocked_ip = ['192.188.4.5'   ,   '222.6.3.8']     // it says which ip you should not answered
restricted_ip = [ '1.5.55.1'   ]     // it says which ip you should to send error 403 means forbidden . 
port_to_run_answer =2030       // the port should use 

write the program any time config file changes update the works. 

and in the "files_to_answer" we have files like (404.html , 403.html , 402.html ,500.html ) 
so when the request is wrong you should send the files contains error good html file . 

write any function with entire error handling not more than one try , catch , 
write the threads handle with threadspool 

and say how to test it with telnet .






test with ********
curl http://localhost:2030/index_page.html
